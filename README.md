### General Information

Carbon dioxide(CO2) is a major contributor of green house gases which in turn is a leading factor for global warming. Reducing the emission of CO2 will be instrumental in reducing the global warming. Here we have created a CO2 emissions dashboard which uses CO2 emission data from EAI (U.S.Energy Information Administration) API.
