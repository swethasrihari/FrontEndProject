          Carbon dioxide(CO2) is a major contributor of green house gases which
          in turn is a leading factor for global warming. Reducing the emission
          of CO2 will be instrumental in reducing the global warming. CO2 is
          emmited from various sources such as electricity, transportation..
          Here we have created a CO2 emissions dashboard for electricity and
          fuel which uses CO2 emission data from EAI (U.S.Energy Information
          Administration) API.
